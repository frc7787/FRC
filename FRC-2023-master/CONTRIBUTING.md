Hello, this is a document with a set of instruction pretaining to commiting new changes to the repository. 

1.
  1# If you would like to commit changes to the repository please ask for a second opinion before commiting, or commit the changes to a seperate branch as opposed to 
  commiting it directly to the master branch.

  2# Please do not commit any changes to the main branch, this has been deprecated, and is no longer in use.

This is a test
